		<h2> Appearance </h2>
		<p> I'm a little turtle with black/pink eyes. My tail is rolled up at the back of my shell. 
			Most of the time I stay outside of my shell but when I am scared (which rarely happens...not) I hide in my shell.
			I can shoot water out of my mouth! (isn't that cool?) MY whole body is blue. (except the shell) My hands and legs are very short!
			I think I look very good actually. I think I can be a supermodel. My brother wartortle keeps braging how much better he looks than me, but
			I disagree. I think I look a lot better.</p>
			
		<h2> Personality </h2>
		<p> Like my brothers I wished to become the strongest pokemon in the world. At first I was the only
			one that was excited to be adopted by Blue. I happily squirted water on his face which got me into really got water. 
			I am very cheeky and love pranking people especially my brothers. I am very naïve which is why Blue is so protective to me. 
			I don't like Blue's Pikachu though. Some day I know I'll be stronger than him anyways. </p>
			
		<p> I trusted Blue deeply even though he was, at first, rather cold towards me, asking to train with him and for him to read me stories. 
			When Blue begins to become more of a parental figure to us, my trust in him deepens more. I am the main reason Blue begins to change his ways, 
			my unconditional adoration of him regardless of how he treats me makes him realise what life is really about. I unwittingly set
			his change in motion after Gru defends me at the pokemon tournament at the amusement park after the attendant mocks me for not
			winning the game which upsets me, and him — "Better luck next time" "OK, my turn". I am very good at ballet, better than Edith and
			almost as good as Margo, but lacking her poise. </p>

		<p> I am not a needy pokemon but do depend on my older brother, Blastoise, a lot. I often look worried if Blastoise walks off ahead of me
			and run after Blastoise, not wanting to be left behind. I also demand Blue fixes my disintegrated toy poketoy, and when I am upset
			at being mocked by the amusement park tournament attendant, I look to Blue with teary eyes for support. When I don't get my way,
			I hold his breath until I do get my way and when I still don't get my way by the time I open my eyes, I pretend to faint, and Wartortle
			implies I have done this numerous times before. </p>

		<p> I have a huge love of pokepuffs, wishing my new trainers to have a gummy bear house, and happily eat out of Pikachu's pet food bowl Blue filled
			with Pokepuffs. I also love fluffy things for example I called Pikachu, Blue's "faaaaavorite pokemon", a fluffy mouse. I am very notable for my strange obsession
			with dogs and wanted to have one for a pet, unaware of the fact that they are mythical creatures. </p>
